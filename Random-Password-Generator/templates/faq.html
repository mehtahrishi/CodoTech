    <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Q: Is the password generation truly random?</h4>
        <p>A: Yes. This app uses Python's `secrets` module, which is designed for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing secrets like passwords and security tokens.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Q: Can I use this in a production environment?</h4>
        <p>A: This is primarily a demonstration project. For production, you should run it behind a proper web server (like Gunicorn or Nginx), enable HTTPS to encrypt traffic, and consider adding more features like a "copy to clipboard" button.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Q: Why does the password change automatically?</h4>
        <p>A: This feature is designed to showcase how a frontend (JavaScript) can interact with a backend API (Flask) to dynamically update content without reloading the page. It's a "live" demonstration of its capability.</p>
