    <h2>What Makes a Password Strong?</h2>
    <p>
        Creating a strong password is one of the most critical steps you can take to secure your online life. Here are the key ingredients:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Length:</strong> Longer is always better. Aim for at least <strong>12-16 characters</strong>. Each additional character exponentially increases the password's complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Complexity:</strong> Use a mix of all character types:
            <ul>
                <li>Uppercase letters (A-Z)</li>
                <li>Lowercase letters (a-z)</li>
                <li>Numbers (0-9)</li>
                <li>Symbols (!@#$%^&*)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Unpredictability:</strong> Avoid using common words, phrases, or personal information like your name, birthday, or pet's name. "Password123" is not your friend!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Use a different, unique password for every single one of your accounts. If one site is breached, your other accounts remain safe.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
